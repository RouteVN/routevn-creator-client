# Description
watching the usability test now here's some things i think would make the user experience better and some bugs i found which wasnt mentioned on the tasks

bugs : 

- [x] [low] seems like you can drag the icon from the line editor and it will give a url (6:31 - 6:33)
- [x] [low] can select a character without any sprite (dont know if is intended) but should have validation (7:45)
- [x] [low] Should make the choices layout required (20:15)
- [x] [low] add transform, should make the transform name required (34:32)


While making usability test, please mention the client version, i noticed that there there was no validation on color creation form but on latest one there is validation for that

Bugs outside of the video

- [x] [critical] @han4wluc layout editor is broken, `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'handleActions')` and will not show any thing on the file explorer
- [x] [medium] add label on character selection on scene editor
- [x] [high] user can preview from a selected line or section they're at
